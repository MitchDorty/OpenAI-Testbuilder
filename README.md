# OpenAI-Testbuilder
creates a simple practice test for a university level course

Still currently a work in progress. So far I have a bare-bones program to create the questions.

Future plans:
1. give the user a way to answer the questions
2. show grade on test and correct answers after completion
3. simple GUI
